| Step | Goal | Activity Focus | Key Deliverable |
|------|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Root Cause Analysis | Research historical discriminatory practices in your domain | Documented historical patterns |
| 2 | Risk Identification | Analyze how those patterns affect your data and model design | Completed Assessment Questionnaire |
| 3 | Prioritization | Quantify risk levels for each pattern | Completed Risk Classification Matrix |
| 4 | Mitigation Planning | Translate high-priority risks into concrete engineering actions | Actionable recommendations for development |

<summary>üìö Step 1: Domain Research (1‚Äì2 hrs)</summary>

**Goal:** Understand past discriminatory practices relevant to your AI system.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Search **legal cases, academic studies, investigative reports**.  
- Identify **explicit (formal)** and **implicit (systemic)** biases.  

**Mechanism Review:**  
- How discrimination occurred, who was affected, and what practices were used.  

**Examples:**  
- **Finance:** ZIP code used to deny loans (Redlining)  
- **Recruitment:** ‚ÄúHigh performance‚Äù metrics excluding marginalized groups  
- **Healthcare:** Differential treatment based on insurance or demographics

<summary>‚ùì Step 2: [1.Historical Context Assessment Questionnaire Completion (1‚Äì2 hrs)</summary>

**Goal:** Detail how historical bias is embedded in data and system logic.  

**Team:** Include **domain experts, data scientists, ethicists, stakeholders**.  

**Focus per Section:**  
1. **Context:** System function and societal impact.  
2. **Data & Representation:** Data sources, variable definitions, group representation.  
3. **Technology & Amplification:** How automation could scale inequities.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Step 3: Risk Classification (30‚Äì60 mins)</summary>

**Goal:** Quantify and prioritize risks to guide intervention.  

**Tool:** Historical Risk Classification Matrix (Severity √ó Likelihood √ó Relevance).  

**Scoring:** High=3, Medium=2, Low=1  

**Criteria:**  
- **Severity:** Harm if bias persists  
- **Likelihood:** Probability bias appears in your system  
- **Relevance:** Direct impact on system decisions  

**Priority:**  
- **High (7‚Äì9):** Critical ‚Üí immediate mitigation  
- **Medium (3‚Äì6):** Monitor & plan mitigation  
- **Low (1‚Äì2):** Awareness, no immediate action

<summary>‚úÖ Step 4: Documentation & Integration (1‚Äì2 hrs)</summary>

**Goal:** Convert prioritized risks into actionable steps for engineering and governance.  

**Final Report:**  
- Compile research, completed Questionnaire, Risk Matrix  

**Actionable Recommendations:**  
- Clear instructions for teams  
- Example: Remove ‚ÄòPatient ZIP Code‚Äô or demonstrate non-disparate impact  

**Integrate Fairness:**  
- Link high-priority risks to chosen fairness definitions  
- Example: Ensure system satisfies **Disparate Impact criteria**  

**Lifecycle Monitoring:**  
- Schedule audits during model retraining  
- Update risk assessments as new patterns/data emerge
