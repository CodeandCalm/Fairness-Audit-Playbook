## 1. Fairness Definition Selection Decision Tree

**Step 1: Historical Context Assessment**  
- Question: Are protected groups historically underrepresented?  
  - **Yes:** Include **Demographic Parity**, then continue to Step 2.  
  - **No:** Skip to Step 2.

**Step 2: Error-Impact Analysis**  
- Question: Which errors matter most?  
  - **False Negatives (missing qualified candidates):** Use **Equal Opportunity**.  
  - **False Positives (selecting unqualified candidates):** Use **Predictive Equality**.  
  - **Both equally critical:** Use **Equalized Odds**.

**Step 3: Outcome Calibration Assessment**  
- Question: Are probabilistic scores exposed to users or analysts?  
  - **Yes:** Add **Calibration / Sufficiency** to metrics.  
  - **No:** Keep previously selected definitions.

## 2. Trade-Off Analysis Template

| Selected Definition | Rationale | Trade-Offs | Performance Implications | Monitoring Approach |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Example: Equal Opportunity | Avoid missing qualified applicants from underrepresented groups | May not achieve demographic parity | Slight increase in candidate pool, minimal quality impact | Track equal opportunity metrics monthly, disaggregated by group |

> Instructions: Fill in for each fairness definition you choose. Document why it was selected, what it sacrifices, and how you will monitor outcomes.

## 3. Case Study: Internal Loan Application System

**Context:**  
- Historical data shows certain groups underrepresented in loan approvals.  
- False negatives (rejecting qualified applicants) are more harmful than false positives.

**Selected Fairness Definition:**  
- **Equal Opportunity**

**Rationale:**  
- Historical bias against qualified applicants from underrepresented groups.  
- Primary goal: ensure qualified applicants are not missed.

**Trade-Offs:**  
- Demographic parity may not be fully satisfied.  
- Slight reduction in precision to guarantee fair opportunity.

**Monitoring Approach:**  
- Monthly review of false negative rates across groups.  
- Track demographic parity as a secondary metric.
