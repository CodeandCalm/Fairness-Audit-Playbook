# 🤖 Fairness-Audit-Playbook
## Introduction

Hi! I’m Tatiana Stacul and this playbook is part of my ongoing project on AI Ethics while studying at Turing College. It aims to provide a structured methodology for evaluating AI systems across multiple dimensions of fairness and bias, bridging theoretical concepts with practical assessment.

You will find a methodology for evaluating **AI systems across multiple fairness dimensions**.  
This framework examines whether AI systems perpetuate historical biases ⚖️, how they align with fairness definitions 🧭, where bias enters systems 🧩, and how these issues manifest in measurable outcomes 📊.  

The Playbook operationalizes fairness through **historical analysis**, **bias identification**, and **quantitative assessment** — building accountability through structured, documented evaluation processes.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project builds across five key components, each addressing a critical stage of fairness assessment:

1️⃣ **Part 1: Historical Context Assessment Tool**  
*Identifies historical discrimination patterns and maps them to AI application risks.*

2️⃣ **Part 2: Fairness Definition Selection Tool**  
*Guides the choice of fairness definitions suited to context and goals.*

3️⃣ **Part 3: Bias Source Identification Tool**  
*Pinpoints where bias can enter across the AI lifecycle.*

4️⃣ **Part 4: Fairness Metrics Tool**  
*Provides strategies for measuring and interpreting fairness quantitatively.*

5️⃣ **Part 5: Fairness Audit Playbook**  
*Synthesizes all tools into a cohesive methodology for ethical AI evaluation.*

## ✨ Purpose

Ensure that **AI design and deployment** align with ethical, social, and historical responsibility — promoting transparency, inclusivity, and trust in technology.
